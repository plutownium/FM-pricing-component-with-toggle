# Plan

2. do the same for month to month
3. make the button toggle the layout

# Order of operations

1. Make the page look nice as mobile + yearly
2. ...then mobile + month to month

# Try to reuse classes!

TODO: make the site reorganize properly on desktop
- move the cards from top-bot to left-right.
